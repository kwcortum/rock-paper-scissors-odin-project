This project is under guidance from the Odin Project. My aim here is to put all the javascript skills I have learned from Codecademy, the Odin Project, Sololearn, and Grasshopper in order to create this simple web app. I will be accomplishing this using VSCode on my linux systems, both Manjaro and Sublime.

I hope to make this app and keep updating as I go around.
